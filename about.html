      <p id="aboutMePara">
        <strong>My name is Megan Helwig and I am a designer, illustrator and web developer living in Richmond, VA.</strong>        I've lived in Richmond since I got my start as a designer with a BA from VCU's Robinson School of Media and Design
        in 2013. The decision to stay in the city has given me the opportunity to work with a variety of small and unique
        agencies, studios and businesses.
        <div id="space">
          My skill set and work ethic have lead me to gain experince in traditional and digital graphic design, illustration, screen
          printing, photography and photo editing, packaging design, social media content strategy/design, in-house design
          and most recently, web development and design. I recieved a Full-Stack Web Developer Certificate from the University
          of Richmond in July of 2018, and have most recently been working with SingleComm as a Software Engineer.
